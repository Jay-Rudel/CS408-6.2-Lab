## Getting Started
    To get started, clone this repository, and then you can learn 
    to view it in the "Viewing" section. Which is below.

## Viewing
    I highly recommend using VSCode Live Server extention to see the project. This allows you to
    see the page, and interact with the page without having to open it in a local file.

    The file that you will be looking at for this project in my github is called "index.html"
    
## Testing
    There is no tests for this project. As such there is no
    command to run them.

## Verification
    I ran my main "index.html" through the validation 
    and it showed that there was no errors or warnings to show

## References / If needed

FIXME:
    The only source I used for this project was the
    reading that was provided to us. Just to make sure
    I could figure out how to do the nav bar. As that was
    what I had problems coding.
