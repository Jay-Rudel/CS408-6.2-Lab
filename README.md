# CS408 - M6.2 Lab
    In this project we are taking files that we have been given and
    using them to make a letter head file. We are also using
    Lorem Ipsum as placeholder text which is used in a lot
    of a different projects as placeholder text.

## Getting Started
    To get started, clone this repository, and then you can learn 
    to view it in the "Viewing" section. Which is below.

## Viewing
    I normally highly recommend using VSCode Live Server extention to see the 
    project. As this allows you to see the page, and interact 
    with the page without having to open it in a local file. 
    However, for this particular file you need to open a the file 
    in the broswer to be able to see the alerts. So for this one, 
    once you open the server please copy the link and paste that 
    into the browser.

    The file that you will be looking at for this project 
    in my github is called "index.html"
    
## Testing
    I did not add any new testing commands, however, I did
    test every single one of the buttons and checked to make sure
    they all worked as intended.

## Verification
    I ran my main "index.html" through the validation 
    and it showed that there was a parsing error but I am
    not sure exactly what it is trying to say to be honest.

## References
    The only source I used for this project was the
    reading that was provided to us. Just to make sure
    I could figure out how to do the function for the radio bar. As that was
    what I had problems coding.
